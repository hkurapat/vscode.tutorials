# CLAUDE.md — vscode.tutorials

This is an R package (`vscode.tutorials`) containing **learnr** tutorials for learning VS Code in GitHub Codespaces. Tutorials live in `inst/tutorials/` as `tutorial.Rmd` files.

## Project layout

```
inst/tutorials/<name>/
  tutorial.Rmd       # main tutorial file
  images/            # images included via include_graphics()

inst/extdata/<name>/ # stable source copies of data students may download
```

Current tutorials: `01-code` through `09-infrastructure`, `r4ds-1` through `r4ds-5`, `census`.

## Philosophy (AI era)

The goal is not to teach coding — it is to teach students how to **use AI to create data science artifacts**. After the initial VS Code and infrastructure tutorials, students should mostly interact with an AI agent that edits their files, renders their Quarto document, and helps them debug. They should learn to steer analysis, inspect output, notice problems, and ask for refinements.

- `01-code` through `09-infrastructure` are setup/infrastructure tutorials. They may repeat core lessons about terminals, GitHub, Codespaces, Quarto, files, and warnings.
- Later tutorials are data science tutorials. They should follow an exploratory path through data toward a useful published artifact.
- Show students **results** (plots, printed tibbles, summary statistics, rendered pages), not just the code that produced them.
- Questions ask students to prompt AI for file edits, render, inspect output, and compare their output to ours.
- Prefer many small exercises that form a data analysis path over one large prompt that solves the whole section.
- Students should not type R into learnr exercise chunks in post-infrastructure tutorials. Their work happens in `analysis.qmd` and supporting files.
- `echo = FALSE` is the default everywhere. Only reveal code when there is a strong pedagogical reason.
- Test chunks (`exercise-N-test`) may produce visible output after students click Continue — this is how we give them something concrete to check against, such as our example plot or tibble.

## Student workflow

Students view all QMD output via **render + Live Server**, not by running code in the R Terminal:

- After editing `analysis.qmd`, students run `quarto render analysis.qmd` in a bash terminal.
- They open `analysis.html` with Live Server once at the start (right-click in File Explorer → "Open with Live Server"); it auto-refreshes on every subsequent render.
- **Never** instruct students to use `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` to run QMD code or `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + K` to render.
- `#| cache: true` is a **render-time** feature — the cache is created during `quarto render`, not by running code interactively. The first render with caching takes noticeably longer; subsequent renders load from disk.
- Cache chunks when students are done with an expensive piece of code. Most tutorials should use caching at least once; tutorials with several expensive visualizations or data-preparation chunks may use it more often.
- Add the generated cache directory (usually `analysis_cache`) to `.gitignore`; cache files do not belong on GitHub.

## Subject-area tutorials

Tutorials after `09-infrastructure` should be organized around prominent data sources and real data science domains, not around book chapters. Examples: US Census data, baseball data, stock data, Bitcoin, and other subject areas where students can learn what analysts actually use.

Each subject-area tutorial should teach:

- The gold-standard data sources for that area.
- The main R packages, APIs, file formats, and vocabulary students should mention to AI.
- Common data patterns, data quality issues, and standard analytical questions in that domain.
- A reproducible workflow that ends with a small published Quarto artifact.

## Tutorial structure

Every tutorial follows this order:

1. **Introduction** — overview of packages/functions covered; exercises to set up the repo, QMD, and libraries.
2. **Topic sections** — each section starts from data, follows an exploratory path, and usually ends with a useful plot or table plus a short interpretation.
3. **Summary** — mirrors the Introduction in past tense; finishes with `quarto publish gh-pages` and a GitHub URL.

### Introduction exercises (standard sequence)

1. Create repo from `codespace-starter` template, open Codespace, create `analysis.qmd`, render, open `analysis.html` with Live Server, set up `.gitignore`, CP/CR.
2. Add `library(tidyverse)` to QMD with `#| message: false` and `execute: echo: false` in YAML, render, check Live Server tab, CP/CR.
3. In a bash terminal, run `quarto render analysis.qmd`; confirm the Live Server tab auto-refreshes. CP/CR.
4. (Optional) Create `data/` directory via `dir.create("data")`, CP/CR.

Replace `XX` placeholders with actual repo names, titles, and knowledge drops.

Keep introductions short. Avoid repeating details that the exercises will teach. If students must read several paragraphs before the first exercise, split the prose with Continue buttons; better yet, cut the prose down.

### Topic exercises

- Begin by getting data into the student's project. Often this means asking AI to create `data/`, download a file from a stable URL, and record where it came from.
- Ask for one concrete edit per exercise. Do not micromanage individual R function arguments unless the detail is pedagogically important.
- Render after every meaningful edit. The Live Server tab is the student's feedback loop.
- Use several linked exercises to build an analysis path: inspect the data, notice a pattern or problem, refine the data, make a rough plot, improve the plot, add interpretation.
- The final section should make the rendered page look good enough to publish.

### Writing student prompts to AI

Describe the **goal**, not the implementation. Students should tell AI what they want to see — a plot of X by Y, a table of the top 10, the distribution of Z — and let the AI choose the functions. This is how professionals actually work, and it gives students practice evaluating whether the AI's approach is correct.

- **Do not** list functions for students to include in their AI prompt (e.g., "use `geom_histogram()` and `scale_x_log10()`").
- **Do not** dictate the pipe steps or function arguments students should pass to AI.
- **Exception**: it is fine to name one key function when it is the explicit concept being taught (e.g., "use `pivot_longer()` to reshape the data") — but only if that function is the point of the exercise, not just an implementation detail.
- Knowledge drops are the right place to introduce function names after students have already seen the output. Students learn what `geom_smooth()` is by noticing it in AI-generated code, not by being told to ask for it.

### Git commit exercises

Each topic section should end with a dedicated commit exercise placed as the last exercise in that section, after the final plot or analysis output. Do not fold it into another exercise.

The exercise asks students to commit `analysis.qmd` with a specific descriptive message. Students may use any of three methods — all are acceptable:

- **AI agent**: "Ask AI to stage `analysis.qmd`, commit with the message `"Add X analysis"`, and push to GitHub."
- **VS Code Source Control panel**: click the branch icon in the sidebar, stage the file, enter the message, and sync.
- **Command line**: `git add analysis.qmd && git commit -m "Add X analysis" && git push` in a bash terminal.

The Summary commit exercise (sequence step 3) should say "commit any remaining changes" — by that point the main content is already committed section by section.

### Exercise rhythm

Most exercises should follow this rhythm:

1. **Prompt AI / edit `analysis.qmd`** — students ask their AI agent to add or change something concrete.
2. **Render** — students run `quarto render analysis.qmd` in a bash terminal and inspect the Live Server tab.
3. **Verify** — students CP/CR evidence that they completed the exercise.
4. **Show the expected output when useful** — after submission, the first thing students see should often be our expected output, answer, plot, tibble, or representative paste.
5. **Knowledge drop** — after submission, provide a short paragraph that tells students what to notice, teaches domain knowledge, or foreshadows the next exercise.

The canonical loop is:

`prompt AI/edit analysis.qmd -> render -> inspect Live Server -> CP/CR evidence -> expected output/answer -> knowledge drop -> next exercise`

### CP/CR evidence

Prefer CP/CR from rendered HTML when the rendered output is what students should inspect: printed tibbles, summaries, tables, and text output. This keeps attention on the published artifact.

Use `show_file()` when checking file contents or code: `.gitignore`, the last chunk, a data-analysis pipeline, chart code, or the final QMD state. When checking chart code or a data pipeline, pair `show_file()` with our rendered plot, tibble, or other output so students can compare both the code and its result.

Use terminal CP/CR for directory structure and command output, such as `list.files()`, `pwd`, `ls`, or render messages.

### Analysis path

Build topic sections from linked exercise units. A typical path:

1. Download or load data and document the source.
2. Inspect rows and individual variables before plotting relationships: printed tibbles, `summary()`, `count()`, histograms, missingness checks, top categories, random/sample rows, or `glimpse()` (avoid `glimpse()` on wide datasets — it prints one line per column).
3. Make students discover the data structure. If a variable will matter later, have students ask AI or consult documentation to learn what it means before using it in a final plot.
4. Notice a problem or opportunity: too many categories, missing values, outliers, awkward variable names, an important subgroup, unclear variable meaning, suspicious data structure, or an unclear plot.
5. Treat incomplete, sampled, truncated, or otherwise suspicious data as a teachable discovery. Ask students to uncover the limitation with summaries or plots, then explain what conclusions are and are not supported.
6. Ask AI to refine the analysis.
7. Make a rough plot or table.
8. Improve labels, grouping, ordering, scale, caption, and visual polish.
9. Add a short interpretation paragraph about what the plot or table shows.

The final artifact should be a published page with a meaningful result about the world, not just a completed worksheet.

### Summary exercises (standard sequence)

1. Final `quarto render`, `show_file("analysis.qmd")`, CP/CR.
2. `quarto publish gh-pages analysis.qmd` in bash Terminal; paste resulting URL.
3. Commit and push any remaining changes; paste GitHub repo URL.

## Question types

### No-answer questions (default)

```r
question_text(NULL,
  answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  try_again_button = "Edit Answer",
  incorrect = NULL,
  rows = 5)
```

Use for CP/CR questions. Set `rows` to match expected output length.

### Yes-answer questions

```r
question_text(NULL,
  message = "Correct answer text here.",
  answer(NULL, correct = TRUE),
  allow_retry = FALSE,
  incorrect = NULL,
  rows = 6)
```

Use when providing the correct answer. Set `allow_retry = FALSE`.

## Knowledge drops

- Usually one short paragraph; one or two sentences is often enough.
- Place after students submit an exercise (after `###`). Place before the question only when context is needed to answer.
- Reference our example output when the test chunk displays a plot, tibble, or summary.
- Tell students what to notice in their rendered output, explain why it matters, or identify the next natural data-science move.
- Do not use recycled/default knowledge drops in post-infrastructure tutorials. Save repeated infrastructure lessons for `01-code` through `09-infrastructure`; later tutorials need knowledge drops tied to the current exercise, current data, or current infrastructure issue.
- Use knowledge drops to teach the data science ecosystem for the tutorial's area: gold-standard data sources, common measures, important packages, file formats, APIs, data-quality issues, and standard patterns analysts look for.
- Name packages and functions students will encounter in AI-generated code — so they can recognize and evaluate them, not so they can dictate them in prompts.
- No road signs ("In the next section..."). Teach something real.
- No rhetorical questions.

## Code chunk conventions

- Label format: `section-name-N` and `section-name-N-test` (e.g., `billboard-3`, `billboard-3-test`).
- Run `tutorial.helpers::check_current_tutorial()` after adding/deleting exercises to renumber everything.
- Use `tutorial.helpers::make_exercise()` to add new exercises with correct numbering.
- `echo = FALSE` everywhere (set globally in setup chunk via `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`).
- Set `knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = '90%')` in setup for consistent image sizing.
- Avoid exercise code chunks in post-infrastructure tutorials. Use question chunks for CP/CR and test chunks for our example output.

## Test chunk output

Test chunk output should be scannable in a few seconds. If it scrolls, it is too long. Apply these fixes before committing:

**Wide tibbles (many columns)** — `glimpse()` prints one line per column; on a 79-column dataset that is 81 lines. Print the tibble directly instead (`billboard`, not `glimpse(billboard)`): tibbles auto-truncate to 10 rows and summarise extra columns on one line. Reserve `glimpse()` for narrow datasets (≤ ~15 columns) where the column-by-column view is genuinely useful.

**CSV column-spec messages** — `read_csv()` prints a column-spec block (one line per column) before the tibble. Suppress it with `show_col_types = FALSE`:

```r
read_csv("../../extdata/r4ds-1/music.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
```

**Long model or computation output** — wrap with `suppressMessages()` or redirect progress with `refresh = 0, silent = 2` (for **brms**). Only show the final object students need to check.

**Plots** — always fine; they produce a single visual, not scrolling text.

**The rule of thumb**: if the rendered test chunk output is taller than a laptop screen, shorten it.

## Setup chunk requirements

```r
library(learnr)
library(tutorial.helpers)
library(tidyverse)
# ...other libraries...

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(out.width = '90%')
options(tutorial.exercise.timelimit = 60, tutorial.storage = "local")
```

Pre-compute only what the tutorial itself needs to show examples after submission. Do not load data merely to support student exercise code chunks in post-infrastructure tutorials.

## Data handling

- Never depend on a fragile third-party URL at tutorial run time.
- Keep stable source copies for student downloads under `inst/extdata/<tutorial>/` when practical, and document the original source.
- Students usually create their own `data/` directory inside their project and download or copy data there.
- In later tutorials, prefer asking AI to download a file from a stable URL and put it in `data/` over teaching students exact `download.file()` syntax, unless that syntax is the point of the exercise.
- Avoid `inst/tutorials/<name>/data/` for new post-infrastructure tutorials unless there is a specific learnr runtime reason.
- Do not download from the web during tutorial compile/run. If a test chunk needs data, load a small stable copy from the package.
- For large data, create smaller teaching files and use CP/CR verification rather than heavy test computations.
- If a teaching dataset is incomplete, sampled, capped, or otherwise artificial, do not hide that fact. Build an exercise path that lets students discover the limitation and reason about how it affects interpretation.

## Authoring with AI agents

When changing or creating subject-area tutorials, use Claude/Gemini iteratively:

- Ask the agent to inspect the existing tutorial and propose changes before editing.
- Correct the agent's plan when it misses project rules, especially the render + Live Server workflow, no post-infrastructure exercise code chunks, data handling, and knowledge drops.
- Make one section correct first. Render it, inspect the result, and revise before applying the same pattern elsewhere.
- Ask the agent what it will do in the next section before it edits.
- Keep expected output, prose, prompts, knowledge drops, and displayed example plots in sync when the data or analysis changes.

## Images

- Store in `images/` directory alongside `tutorial.Rmd`.
- Include with `knitr::include_graphics("images/example.png")` in an unnamed chunk.
- Requires `library(knitr)` in the setup chunk.

## Displaying code verbatim in tutorials

Use `<pre><code>` wrappers (not four backticks) to display R code chunks verbatim inside tutorial text:

```
<pre><code>```{r}
1 + 1
```</code></pre>
```

When showing multiple commands for students to copy/paste, make sure they render as separate lines. Do not let Markdown collapse separate commands into one paragraph.

## Checking a tutorial

1. **Quick syntax check**: `rmarkdown::render("inst/tutorials/name/tutorial.Rmd")` — open resulting HTML in browser.
2. **Full check**: `devtools::check()` (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + E`) — must pass before any PR.
3. **Student perspective**: `devtools::install()` then `learnr::run_tutorial("tutorial_name", "vscode.tutorials")`.

`devtools::check()` validates that all tutorials include the default `copy-code-chunk` and `download-answers` chunks from the `tutorial_template`. Do not remove or alter these.

## Formatting conventions

- Keyboard input and inline code: `backticks`
- Package names: **bolded**
- Function names always include parentheses: `read_csv()`, not `read_csv`
- Section/topic titles: sentence case
- Terminal names: `R Terminal` and `bash terminal`
- Abbreviation: CP/CR = Copy/Paste the Command/Response

## DESCRIPTION

Any library loaded in a tutorial must appear under `Imports` or `Suggests` in `DESCRIPTION`. `devtools::check()` on GitHub Actions will fail if a package is `library()`-ed but not listed.
